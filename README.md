=========

A static version of the documentation is available [here](http://tmandry.dreamhosters.com/db-team07/annotated.html).

We use [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) for documentation. To generate docs, install doxygen, then type
```sh
$ doxygen
```
in your terminal. Navigate to `doc/index.html` in your browser. Easy!
